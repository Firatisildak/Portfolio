            <h3>Hello, It's Me</h3>
            <h1>Fırat Işıldak</h1>
            <h3>And I'm a <span class="multiple-text"></span></h3>
            <p> I recently graduated
                from Iskenderun Technical University with a
                degree in computer engineering. Throughout
                my education, I have focused on backend
                development, gaining expertise in SQL,
                database management, Java, C#, C++, and C.
                During a summer internship at Sanal Soft, I
                honed my frontend skills, working with
                JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This experience
                emphasized the importance of teamwork and
                effective communication, enhancing my ability
                to collaborate effectively. Additionally, I
                furthered my backend skills, particularly in PHP.
                I am proficient in various technologies including
                Java, C#, .Net, Entity Framework, SQL, HTML,
                CSS, Bootstrap, Git/Github, and PHP. Now,
                driven by my passion for continuous learning
                and self-improvement, I aspire to build a
                successful career in the field of technology. </p>

            <h3>Backend Developer</h3>
            <p> I was born in the eastern part of Turkey in 2002, and I spent a significant portion of my life in Izmir. During high school, I received a predominantly mathematical education, which greatly influenced my decision to pursue engineering. I graduated from the computer engineering department and have never failed throughout my academic journey.
                Beyond my formal education, I have consistently sought self-improvement and acquired new skills.</p>
            <p class="hidden"> I have worked on numerous projects and obtained various certifications to broaden my capabilities. I have adopted principles of progress and hard work as a way of life, striving to become a global citizen.
                In addition to my professional endeavors, I have maintained interests in sports and hobbies. I enjoy activities such as bodybuilding, reading, camping, and cycling, which help me maintain a balance between physical and mental well-being.
                I dedicate myself to continuous learning and improvement, aiming to make each day productive and fulfilling. I aspire to further develop myself and achieve success in line with these principles in the future.
